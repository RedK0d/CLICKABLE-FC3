 # TROUBLESHOOTING WITH V1.1.1a-beta
 Some files need to be copied into the base directory of the game, this can only be done with write permissions.
If the mod does not launch with the F-15C, simply start the game by right-clicking "run as administrator" to fix the problem.

This method is temporary, we will update the mod very soon, with a version that will use OVGME and it will be easier.

 # INSTALLATION 

Simply unzip the contents of the archive in your "Saved Games\DCS\Mods\tech\" directory.


Then launch the game.
You can you can manage the activation of the module in the options.

Please report conflicts with others mods.
